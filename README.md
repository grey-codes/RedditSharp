# RedditSharp

## What is this?

**RedditSharp** is an online Reddit client written using Angular 11. The name is inspired by the sharp angles used in the visual design, as well as the fact that the project is... well... angular. 
It aims to provide a material design spin on the classic Reddit UI, mirroring and refining the original functionality of the website.

Features:
* Responsive UI which takes full advantage of desktop and mobile displays
* Infinite scrolling
* Rich embeds
* Modular code
* OAuth2.0 implementation
* Minimal external libraries
* Strict typescript linting
* Continuous integration
* Standardized code formatting

All of this makes for a visually pleasing and performant client.
